## Usage
So on the very base of it, we are trying to make a Web app that helps us **track, visualize, and make people remember their connections.**

## Motivation
Have you ever felt that going to an event leads you with no more than 2 to 3 connections or maybe even half of the people that went there you do not remember. This is a problem that we all face in such cases, especially to non-professionals such as students that want to grow their connection. _Imagine bagging a high positioned recruiter, but fumbled to stay connected after a days to weeks._ **IT HURTS!**

This web app offers features such as email suggestions to follow up with your connections, sematic search, and we even considered typing your connections manually instead of doing that we have an open ai feature that scans the PDF of your connections for you. 

The app also features a ranking system that ranks your connections from Atmos importance. So this feature allows the user, to know which connection would be beneficial for you from matching your career education to even the position of these connections.
 
So, how do people remember new people?
We would also like to highlight that we managed to pull some background research, **because staring at someones face is NOT enough**. People actually remember new individuals better when they associate them with where they met. There is this thing called encoding specificity principle, that suggest that people recall events more accurately when in the same location where they occurred, hence why we have features that highlights the locations and events specifically to that person.
