  "message": "Hi Laurent,\n\nI hope this message finds you well! It’s been a while since our days at BINUS University. I came across your profile here on LinkedIn and noticed your impressive journey as an IT Product Owner at Kawan Lama Group. It’s incredible how we both took the path from System Analysis to Product Ownership, though I see you're leading the charge now.\n\nI’d love to reconnect and catch up on your experiences, especially your transition from a System Analyst to managing IT products. It seems there's always something new to learn in this field, and I believe we'd have some insightful discussions about the challenges and innovations in the IT sector.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\nAndre"
