Subject: Reconnecting and Catching Up

Hi Laurent,

I hope this email finds you well! It's been a while since we last connected, and I've been thinking about how great it would be to catch up. Whether it was during our time at BINUS University or through our professional circles, it was always a pleasure to engage in discussions with you.

I see that you've been making impressive strides in your career as an IT Product Owner at Kawan Lama Group. Your journey from a System Analyst to where you are now is truly inspiring. I'd love to hear more about your experiences and the exciting projects you're working on.

As fellow alumni of the Information Systems program, we both share a strong foundational background. It would be great to discuss the evolution of the industry since our days at BINUS and how those changes have influenced your work, particularly in product ownership and system analysis.

Whenever youâ€™re available, I'd love to reconnect over coffee or a virtual meeting. Please let me know what works best for you.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Warm regards,

Andre
