I see you've made impressive strides at Amazon, progressing through various roles to become a Senior Applied Scientist. That's truly commendable!\n\nSpeaking of which, I remember our discussions about the fantastic opportunities at The University of Texas at Austin. It must have been quite an experience to transition from there to such a pivotal role at Amazon. I'd love to hear more about how your education helped shape your journey, especially in the field of applied sciences.\n\nAlso, I noticed your stint as a Research Assistant at VJTI. Working on research projects there must have been quite enriching. If you're available for a chat sometime, I'd love to catch up and learn more about your current projects and any exciting developments in the field.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n\nBest regards,\nAndre"
