  "message": "Hi Abhishek,\n\nI hope you're doing well! It's been a while since we last connected, and I thought it would be great to catch up. I was reminiscing about our time at The University of Texas at Austin and the exciting projects we came across there. Your journey from a Research Assistant at VJTI to your impressive role as a Senior Applied Scientist at Amazon is truly inspiring.\n\nIt would be fantastic to hear more about the work you're doing at Amazon now, especially your experience transitioning from a Software Development Engineer to an Applied Scientist. I'm sure there's a lot of innovation happening, and I'd love to learn from your insights. Perhaps we can discuss some of the latest trends in applied science and technology?\n\nLooking forward to reconnecting!\n\nBest regards,\n\nAndre"
